(node:40748) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///C:/shangtangzhuye/server/server.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to C:\shangtangzhuye\server\package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
